      <h3>Breif descripton of me and my interests</h3>

            Hello my name is Thomas,
            I am a Fifteen year old Canadian high school student that enjoys many common
            teenage things while not in school. Those things include stuff like,

            <li>Creating Art for people and posting it primarily on my Instagram
            <li>I enjoy listening to Rock& Metal music while chilling and drawing or gaming
            <li>Playing Video Games with family and friends is also something I enjoy doing
            <li>I enjoy biking or taking nature walks through the brush (however I'm very
             picky as to what counts as nature walks so I don't do them often)
            <li>Woodworking also interests me but I don't do it that often
            <li>Or even just simply talking to friends over voice call& messages

          </p>
        </article>

            Those are just some simple examples of what I enjoy filling my free time up
            with. if your interested in hearing a more in depth description of what I enjoy
            then go check out this page where I do exactly that.
