      <h3>Breif descripton of me and my interests</h3>

        <article>
          <p>
            Hello my name is Thomas,
            I am a Fifteen year old Canadian high school student that enjoys many common
            teenage things while not in school. Those things include stuff like,

          <p>-Creating Art for people and posting it primarily on my Instagram</p>
          <p>-I enjoy listening to Rock& Metal music while chilling and drawing or gaming</p>
          <p>-Playing Video Games with family and friends is also something I enjoy doing</p>
          <p>-I enjoy biking or taking nature walks through the brush (however I'm very
           picky as to what counts as nature walks so I don't do them often)</p>
          <p>-Woodworking also interests me but I don't do it that often</p>
          <p>-Or even just simply talking to friends over voice call& messages</p>

            Those are just some simple examples of what I enjoy filling my free time up
            with. if your interested in hearing a more in depth description of what I enjoy
            then go check out this page where I do exactly that.
