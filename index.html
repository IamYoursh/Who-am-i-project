            Hello Im Thomas. I am a fifteen year old high school student living in Edmonton Alberta, and to be honest there isnt to much to do in Edmonton that isnt out of the ordinary but as a lazy teenager who doesnt do to much It doesnt really bother me. Most of my interests arent very activity heavy for one of two reasons, 1 is beacuse it just involves sitting down and not moving anything other than your hands, or 2 Im not really able to fully experience the joy of that activity because of limits, anyway my interests consist of things like

            <li>Creating Art for people and posting it primarily on my Instagram
            <li>I enjoy listening to Rock& Metal music while chilling and drawing or gaming
            <li>Playing Video Games with family and friends is also something I enjoy doing
            <li>I enjoy biking or taking nature walks through the brush (however I'm very
             picky as to what counts as nature walks so I don't do them often)
            <li>Woodworking also interests me but I don't do it that often
            <li>Or even just simply talking to friends over voice call& messages

            Those are just some examples of what I enjoy filling my free time up with. if your interested in hearing a more in depth description of why I enjoy these activities then go check out this page linked below where I do exactly that.
