Hello my name is Thomas,
I am a Fifteen year old Canadian high school student that enjoys many common
teenage things while not in school. Those things include stuff like,

  -Creating Art for people and posting it primarily on my Instagram

  -I enjoy listening to Rock& Metal music while chilling and drawing or gaming

  -Playing Video Games with family and friends is also something I enjoy doing

  -I enjoy biking or taking nature walks through the brush, however I'm very
   picky as to what counts as nature walks so I don't do them often

  -Woodworking also interests me but I don't do it that often

  -Or even just simply talking to friends over voice call& messages

Those are just some simple examples of what I enjoy filling my free time up
with. if your interested in hearing a more in depth description of what I enjoy
then go check out this page where I do exactly that

(link to other page)

Being in high school often times means that people have an idea of what they
wanna do in the future but I honestly haven't really given it much thought
other than id appreciate a career in creating art or maybe preparing food for
people.

If I go through with a career in art then I think I'll look to be an
illustrator for children's books seeing as how my art is very smooth and
cartoon like.

However if I look for a career in food then I would like to become a
cook/chef and make food for people at some fairly high-end place that doesn't
take things to seriously.
