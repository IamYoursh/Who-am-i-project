            <li>Creating Art for people and posting it primarily on my Instagram

              <h4>Ever since I was very little I loved art and always have had a nack for making it, most days i jsut do simple cartoon like things with my trusty pencil but i will once and a while paint and even get crafty creating stuff from recyclables that I think i can make use of. I normally ask poeple what they would like to see me draw/paint/craft if i dont have any insperation on what to create, then once ive finished my peices of art ill often always post them onto my instagram account for the people I know to see. I hope to make some sort of career in art but I havent really looked into it, i often think of possibly becoming a illistrator for childrens books because of my friendly art style and cartoony visuals. 
              </h4>

            <li>I enjoy listening to Rock& Metal music while chilling and drawing or gaming



            <li>Playing Video Games with family and friends is also something I enjoy doing



            <li>I enjoy biking or taking nature walks through the brush (however I'm very
             picky as to what counts as nature walks so I don't do them often)



            <li>Woodworking also interests me but I don't do it that often



            <li>Or even just simply talking to friends over voice call& messages
