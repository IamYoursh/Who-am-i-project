Hello my name is Thomas,
I am a Fifteen year old Canadian high school student that enjoys many common teenage things while not in school. Those things include stuff like,

  -Creating Art for people and posting it primarily on my Instagram
  -I enjoy listening to Rock&Metal music while chilling and drawing or gaming
  -Playing Video Games with family and friends is also something I enjoy doing
  -I enjoy biking or taking nature walks through the brush, however I'm very
   picky as to what counts as nature walks so I don't do them often
  -Woodworking also interests me but I don't do it that often
