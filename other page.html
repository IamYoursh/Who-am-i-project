            <li>Creating Art for people and posting it primarily on my Instagram
            <li>I enjoy listening to Rock& Metal music while chilling and drawing or gaming
            <li>Playing Video Games with family and friends is also something I enjoy doing
            <li>I enjoy biking or taking nature walks through the brush (however I'm very
             picky as to what counts as nature walks so I don't do them often)
            <li>Woodworking also interests me but I don't do it that often
            <li>Or even just simply talking to friends over voice call& messages
